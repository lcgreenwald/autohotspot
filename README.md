KM4ACK autohotspot installer with user supplied hotspot IP address

2020/01/08

I have modified KM4ACK's excellent autohotspot installer sripts by adding a query to allow the user to enter his/her own IP address instead of the hard coded 10.10.10.10 default IP address.

During the install you will need a few pieces of information, you will need:

Current WiFi SSID & Current WiFi Password, New hotspot IP address and password.


Enjoy.
